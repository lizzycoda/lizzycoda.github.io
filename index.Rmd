Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics with a Specialization in Statistics at UC San Diego where I am advised by Ery Arias-Castro. My research interests are in statistics and machine learning and include clustering, embedding, and dimensionality reduction. Previously, I received a bachelor's degree in physics and applied mathematics from UC Berkeley. Before graduate school, I also  worked full-time as a data scientist on methods to produce safer and more robust deep learning models.
